Installation
==============================================

Installation is very straight forward. Either install the package from pip
(``pip install django-aboutconfig``) or from the `sources <https://gitlab.com/impala1/django-aboutconfig>`_.

After installing the package, apply migrations with ``manage.py migrate`` and collect static with
``manage.py collectstatic``.

That's it, you're done.

Next, :ref:`set the configuration options <Configuration Options>`.
